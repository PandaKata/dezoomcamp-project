# Analysis of Covid Data around the world 

## Used Technologies 
For this project I decided to use the following tools:

Docker - to proceed to the containerization of other technologies; <br>
Prefect - for orchestration; <br>
Terraform - as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool; <br>
Google Cloud Storage (GCS) - for storage as Data Lake; <br>
Google BigQuery - for the project Data Warehouse; <br>
dbt - for the transformation of raw data in refined data; <br>
Google Looker studio - for visualizations.
