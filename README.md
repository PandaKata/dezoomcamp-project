# Analysis of Covid Data around the world 

## Used Technologies 
For this project I decided to use the following tools:

Docker - to proceed to the containerization of other technologies;
Prefect - for orchestration;
Terraform - as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool;
Google Cloud Storage (GCS) - for storage as Data Lake;
Google BigQuery - for the project Data Warehouse;
dbt - for the transformation of raw data in refined data;
Google Looker studio - for visualizations.
